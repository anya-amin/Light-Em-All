# Light-Em-All
Project using the Language Java 

The goal of the game is to rotate the already placed tiles to connect pipes, and therefore create a path. When the pipes connect, it signals a yellow light to flow through the connected sections. As tiles connect, the light illuminates the path, and the goal is to light up the entire board with the fewest clicks possible. Anytime through this, the player has to use the arrows of the keyboard to move the icon through the lit and connected paths only. The bottom of the screen also keeps track of the number of clicks for the player's use. The project reinforced my understanding of grid-based game logic, user interaction handling, and optimization strategies. Moreover, I gained more knowledge of how to design efficient algorithms for detecting connected paths and updating visual feedback according to the player's actions.
