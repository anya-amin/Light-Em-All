# Light-Em-All
Major Project of Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 using the language Java

This was the last major project of this class, in which the user has to essentially select tiles to turn the pipes in order for them to connect. As the tiles are turned and they connect, the yellow light goes through the parts that are connected to indicate that it has been lit. The goal of the game is to get the whole board lit and move the marker through the connected tiles. Moreover, one is supposed to have the least number of clicks in this scenario.
